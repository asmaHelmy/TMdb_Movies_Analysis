## Motivation:

The movies industry has changed over the years, we are going to explore some of these changes and make some observations about the data.

## In this notebook I explored these three questions:

1. Is the more you spent on the movie the more you gain or not necessarily? (budget-revenue relationship)
2. Is the more popular the movie the more it gains? (popularity-revenue relationship)
3. Are vote average and popularity related?


## Results:
- There was an increasing trend in both the budgets and the revenues of the movies over the years, both peaked at about 2000-2001 then decreased a bit till 2010.
- There's some evidence to say that the more the movie is budgeted, the high likely it will succeed, further testing or prediction can be done later.
- It's not necessarily that the more the more revenue the movie had the popular it is.
- There's no evidence that popularity has anything to do with the movie's votings.
